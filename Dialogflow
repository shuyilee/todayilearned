Dialogflow Components

Agents

A Dialogflow agent is a virtual agent that handles conversation with end users. Falls under the natural language understanding module that understands human language. 
translates end user text/audio -> structured data that systems can understand
Similar to human call center agent, a Dialogflow agent needs to be trained to handle conversation scenarios. 

Intents

As it's name sounds, an intent helps to categorise an end user's intention for a conversation turn. We combine intents to handle a complete conversation. 
Dialogflow helps to match  end-user expression (words or text by end-user) to the best intent in agent.

Intent classification

Matching an intent to end-user expression.
